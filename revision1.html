            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>
                I run cross country for Madison Academic High School. We are a D1 small school. My personal record for a 5k is 19:33. We have a solid cross country team this season,
                and we are going to win state. I started running in 7th grade and have run ever since. I ran for Northeast Academic Middle School, and we won regions every year.
                I have been to state twice. I was alternate my sophomore year. I ran my junior year as the 7th runner but placed 6th on the team running my PR time. My goal for my senior year
                is to run around an 18 minute 5k.

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>
                I am on the varsity soccer team for Madison Academic High School Mens Soccer team. I play right wing and occasionally right full back. I have been playing soccer ever since I was 6.
                I started playing in a recreational league until 3rd grade where I got offered to play travel league. I played travel for three years where I played striker. I took a break during middle
                school, so I could focus on middle school sports. I then started my 7th and 8th grade year receiving MVP for my last season. Coming into my senior year, my goal is to win state.
                It has been a long ride playing soccer, and I would like to end it well.
